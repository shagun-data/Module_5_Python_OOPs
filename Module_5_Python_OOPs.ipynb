        "# 1 What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects,\n",
        "# which can contain data (attributes) and methods (functions). OOP promotes modularity, code reusability, and abstraction.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 2 What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "# A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the attributes (data) and methods (behavior) that objects of the class will have.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 3 What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "# An object is an instance of a class. It represents a real-world entity and is used to access the properties and methods defined in the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 4 What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "# Abstraction: Focuses on hiding the implementation details and showing only the functionality.\n",
        "# Encapsulation: Focuses on wrapping data and methods into a single unit (class) and restricting access using access modifiers.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 5 What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "# Dunder methods (short for double underscore methods) are special methods in Python that begin and end with double underscores (e.g., `__init__`, `__str__`).\n",
        "# They are used to define object behavior for built-in operations, such as initialization, representation, and comparisons.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 6 Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
        "# Inheritance allows a class (child) to acquire the properties and methods of another class (parent), promoting code reuse and a hierarchical structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 7 What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "# Polymorphism means \"many forms.\" It allows a single interface or method to represent different underlying forms, such as a single method behaving differently in different classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 8 How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "# Encapsulation is achieved by using private attributes (prefixing attribute names with a double underscore `__`) and public methods to access or modify these attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 9 What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "# A constructor is a special method (`__init__`) in Python that is automatically called when an object of a class is created.\n",
        "# It is used to initialize the object's attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 10 What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "# Class Method: Declared using `@classmethod`. It takes `cls` (class reference) as its first parameter and can modify class-level attributes.\n",
        "# Static Method: Declared using `@staticmethod`. It does not take `self` or `cls` and is used for utility functions within a class.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 11 What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "# Method overloading refers to defining multiple methods with the same name but different numbers or types of parameters.\n",
        "# Python does not support true method overloading but can achieve similar behavior using default parameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 12 What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "# Method overriding allows a child class to provide a specific implementation of a method already defined in its parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 13 What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "# The `@property` decorator is used to define getter, setter, and deleter methods for a class attribute.\n",
        "# It allows a method to be accessed like an attribute.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 14 Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "# Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common parent class.\n",
        "# This makes code more flexible and extensible.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 15 What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "# An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated and is designed to be subclassed.\n",
        "# It contains one or more abstract methods (methods declared but not implemented). Abstract classes are defined using the `abc` module.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 16 What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "# 1. Code reusability through inheritance.\n",
        "# 2. Modular code organization.\n",
        "# 3. Abstraction and encapsulation for better security and maintenance.\n",
        "# 4. Polymorphism allows for dynamic behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 17 What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "# Class Variable: Shared across all instances of a class.\n",
        "# Instance Variable: Unique to each object and can have different values for each instance.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 18 What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "# Multiple inheritance allows a class to inherit from more than one parent class, enabling the child class to have access to the properties and methods of all parent classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 19 Explain the purpose of `__str__` and `__repr__` methods in Python.\n",
        "# `__str__`: Defines a human-readable string representation of an object.\n",
        "# `__repr__`: Defines an unambiguous string representation of an object (used for debugging).\n",
        "\n",
        "# 20 What is the significance of the `super()` function in Python?\n",
        "# The `super()` function is used to call a method from the parent class, allowing access to overridden methods and constructor initialization in the parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 21 What is the significance of the `__del__` method in Python?\n",
        "# The `__del__` method is a destructor method called when an object is deleted or goes out of scope. It is used for cleanup tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 22 What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "# @staticmethod: Does not take `self` or `cls` as an argument and is used for utility methods.\n",
        "# @classmethod: Takes `cls` as an argument and can modify class-level attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 23 How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "# Polymorphism works by allowing the same method name in a parent class to be overridden in child classes to provide different functionality.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 24 What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "# Method chaining allows multiple methods to be called on the same object in a single statement by returning `self` at the end of each method.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 25 What is the purpose of the `__call__` method in Python?\n",
        "# The `__call__` method allows an instance of a class to be called as if it were a function.\n"
